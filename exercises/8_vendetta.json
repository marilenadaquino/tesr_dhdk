{"description": "A seminal graphic novel that defined sophisticated storytelling, Alan Moore's best-selling V For Vendetta is a terrifying portrait of totalitarianism and resistance, superbly illustrated by artist David Lloyd. The graphic novel that inspired the hit movie V For Vendetta is a powerful story about loss of freedom and individuality.Set in a futuristic totalitarian England, a country without political freedom, personal freedom and precious little faith in anything,a mysterious man in a white porcelain mask fights political oppressors through terrorism and seemingly absurd acts. It's a gripping tale of the blurred lines between ideological good and evil. - Publisher.", "key": "/works/OL2897797W", "title": "V for Vendetta", "subject_places": ["Great Britain", "England"], "first_publish_date": "1988", "authors": [{"author": {"key": "/authors/OL440715A"}, "type": {"key": "/type/author_role"}}, {"author": {"key": "/authors/OL7519918A"}, "type": {"key": "/type/author_role"}}], "subject_times": ["1979-1997"], "subjects": ["Fiction", "Graphic novels", "Comic books, strips", "Politics and government", "Anarchism", "England in fiction", "Great Britain in fiction", "Totalitarianism in fiction", "English Science fiction", "Totalitarianism", "Anarchism in fiction", "Comics & graphic novels, crime & mystery", "Literature", "nyt:paperback-graphic-books=2009-03-29", "New York Times bestseller", "Fiction, mystery & detective, general", "Comics & graphic novels, general", "nyt:hardcover-graphic-books=2009-09-27", "Comics & graphic novels, literary", "Comics & graphic novels, dystopian"], "type": {"key": "/type/work"}, "covers": [12293384, 6387323, 10232101, 8053105, 8430648, 11282041, 13913260, 7674518], "latest_revision": 26, "revision": 26, "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2009-12-10T00:58:49.974872"}, "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2023-10-31T07:30:13.218828"}}
