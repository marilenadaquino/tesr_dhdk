         <h1>Songs of Innocence</h1>
         <div>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div>
               <p>Piping down the valleys wild, </p>
               <p>Piping songs of pleasant glee, </p>
               <p>On a cloud I saw a child, </p>
               <p>And he laughing said to me: </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>"Pipe a song about a Lamb!" </p>
               <p>So I piped with merry chear. </p>
               <p>"Piper, pipe that song again;" </p>
               <p>So I piped, he wept to hear. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>"Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe; </p>
               <p>Sing thy songs of happy chear:" </p>
               <p>So I sung the same again, </p>
               <p>While he wept with joy to hear. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>"Piper, sit thee down and write </p>
               <p>In a book, that all may read." </p>
               <p>So he vanis​'d from my sight, </p>
               <p>And I pluck​'d a hollow reed, </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>And I made a rural pen, </p>
               <p>And I stain​'d the water clear, </p>
               <p>And I wrote my happy songs </p>
               <p>Every child may joy to hear. </p>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div>
            <h2>The Shepherd</h2>
            <div>
               <p>How sweet is the Shepherd​'s sweet lot! </p>
               <p>From the morn to the evening he strays; </p>
               <p>He shall follow his sheep all the day, </p>
               <p>And his tongue shall be filled with praise. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>For he hears the lamb​'s innocent call, </p>
               <p>And he hears the ewe​'s tender reply; </p>
               <p>He is watchful while they are in peace, </p>
               <p>For they know when their Shepherd is nigh. </p>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div>
            <h2>The Ecchoing Green</h2>
            <div>
               <p>The Sun does arise, </p>
               <p>And make happy the skies; </p>
               <p>The merry bells ring </p>
               <p>To welcome the Spring; </p>
               <p>The sky​-lark and thrush, </p>
               <p>The birds of the bush, </p>
               <p>Sing louder around </p>
               <p>To the bells' chearful sound, </p>
               <p>While our sports shall be seen </p>
               <p>On the Ecchoing Green. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>Old John, with white hair, </p>
               <p>Does laugh away care, </p>
               <p>Sitting under the oak, </p>
               <p>Among the old folk. </p>
               <p>They laugh at our play, </p>
               <p>And soon they all say: </p>
               <p>"Such, such were the joys </p>
               <p>When we all, girls &amp; boys, </p>
               <p>In our youth time were seen </p>
               <p>On the Ecchoing Green." </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>Till the little ones, weary, </p>
               <p>No more can be merry; </p>
               <p>The sun does descend, </p>
               <p>And our sports have an end. </p>
               <p>Round the laps of their mothers </p>
               <p>Many sisters and brothers, </p>
               <p>Like birds in their nest, </p>
               <p>Are ready for rest, </p>
               <p>And sport no more seen </p>
               <p>On the darkening Green. </p>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div>
            <h2>The Lamb</h2>
            <div>
               <p>Little lamb, who made thee? </p>
               <p>Dost thou know who made thee? </p>
               <p>Gave thee life &amp; bid thee feed, </p>
               <p>By the stream &amp; o​'er the mead; </p>
               <p>Gave thee clothing of delight, </p>
               <p>Softest clothing, wooly, bright; </p>
               <p>Gave thee such a tender voice, </p>
               <p>Making all the vales rejoice? </p>
               <p>Little Lamb, who made thee? </p>
               <p>Dost thou know who made thee? </p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>Little Lamb, I​'ll tell thee, </p>
               <p>Little Lamb, I​'ll tell thee: </p>
               <p>He is called by thy name, </p>
               <p>For he calls himself a Lamb. </p>
               <p>He is meek &amp; he is mild; </p>
               <p>He became a little child. </p>
               <p>I a child &amp; thou a lamb. </p>
               <p>We are called by his name. </p>
               <p>Little Lamb, God bless thee! </p>
               <p>Little Lamb, God bless thee!</p>
